          Hey, thank you for the issue. This is an automatic message. I usually answer within a few hours.
          
          I would like to ask you if the problem occurs with a specific page to indicate its address, if you have not provided it yet. This significantly reduces the time to provide assistance.
          
          Sincerely,
